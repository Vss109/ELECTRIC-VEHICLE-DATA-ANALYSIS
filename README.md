# ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-DATA-ANALYSIS
Analysis on EV using Tableau 

🚗⚡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

The goal of this project was to analyze the adoption and growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the U.S. and identify key trends driving the clean energy transition. Using Tableau, I designed an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore EV data from multiple perspectives.

Key Features of the Dashboard:

📊 KPIs: Total EVs (1,50,422), Average Range (67.83 miles), BEVs vs PHEVs market share.

📈 Trend Analysis: Growth of EV adoption by model year, highlighting a sharp rise after 2017.

🌍 Geographic Analysis: State-wise distribution of EVs across the U.S.

🚘 Top Manufacturers: Tesla leads with 67% share, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford.

🔄 CAFV Eligibility: Breakdown of EVs by Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle eligibility.

🏆 Popular Models: Tesla Model Y & Model 3 dominate EV registrations.

Tools & Skills Used:

Tableau → Dashboard design, KPIs, filters, maps, and charts

Data Analysis → Trend, distribution, and categorical insights

Storytelling → Transforming raw EV data into actionable insights

Insights & Impact:

Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is clear, with Model Y and Model 3 accounting for ~37% of all EVs.

EV adoption has accelerated post-2017, indicating growing consumer interest and policy support.

State-level analysis shows which regions are leading in clean mobility.

CAFV eligibility highlights the role of policy incentives in EV adoption.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, create business-ready dashboards, and derive actionable insights for stakeholders in the automobile and energy sector.
