# ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-DATA-ANALYSIS
Analysis on EV using Tableau 

# ðŸš—âš¡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis â€“ Tableau Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the adoption and growth of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** across the United States using **Tableau**.  
The interactive dashboard provides insights into **total EVs, BEVs vs PHEVs market share, state-level adoption, top manufacturers, CAFV eligibility, and popular EV models**.  

The goal of this project is to transform raw EV data into **actionable insights** that highlight market trends, growth patterns, and the future of sustainable mobility.
